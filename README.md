2. The Analysis based on price with neighbourhood group
3. The Analysis based on order of price
4. The Analysis based on room types with neighbourhood group

6. The Analysis based on top place with neighbourhood group

In  analysis based on host with calculated host listings count, we analysed that the total number of properties owned by different hosts in every neighbourhood group. 
From that, we can conclude that the Sonder(NYC) from Manhattan is the busiest host and having maximum number of properties.

In analysis based on price with neighbourhood group,  we have done analysis on price with different neighbourhood groups,   minimum price for each neighbourhood group, maximum price for each neighbourhood group, mean price for each neighbourhood group. Through this analysis, we concluded that the Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens has the Maximum price.

In  analysis based on order of price, we have  sorted into  the price ranges from highest price to lowest price. From that, we can find the "Furnished room in Astoria apartment" from Queens , "Luxury 1 bedroom apt. -stunning Manhattan views" from Brooklyn and "1-BR Lincoln Centre" from Manhattan which are the most expensive.

In analysis based on room types with neighbourhood group, total number of different room types has found in each neighbourhood group. From that, we can observe that the neighbourhood groups Brooklyn and Manhattan in which room type of private room and Entire home/apt only mostly occupied.
